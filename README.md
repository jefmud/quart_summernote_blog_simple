# quart_summernote_blog_simple
A simple blog built on Quart, Summernote (WYSIWIG editor) and TinyMongo

Built on Quart

Quart asyncio (https://github.com/pgjones/quart)

Quart is the ASYNCIO version of Flask.  The project takes some of the strongest features of Armin Ronacher's Flask project and moves it into the Python 3 asynchronous realm.  Porting simple Flask apps to Quart is relatively trivial, but you should look carefully at their documentation.

Summernote - a very nice JavaScript WYSIWYG editor (https://github.com/summernote/summernote)

TinyMongo - kind of like the SQLite local version of PyMongo (https://github.com/schapman1974/tinymongo)
